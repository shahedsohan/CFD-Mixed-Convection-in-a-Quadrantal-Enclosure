# CFD-Mixed-Convection-in-a-Quadrantal-Enclosure
This study investigates magnetohydrodynamic mixed convective heat transport within a rotating cylinder-equipped enclosure. It employs finite element analysis to explore a range of parameters' effects on heat transfer, including magnetic field strength, Richardson number, Reynolds number, and cylinder diameter.
